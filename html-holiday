   <br>
    <h5 class="dates">December 20, 2024</h5>

    <h3 class="title">2-Day trip to Hamilton and Rotorua</h3>
    <br>
    <h5 class="dates">December 26-27, 2024</h5>
    <br>
    <p class="description">We woke up at around 5 a.m. and prepared our stuff that we will be taking to the trip. Me and my dad went to 
    the car rental shop to rent a Van. Then we were set to go. Our first stop was Hamilton Gardens and then
    Rotorua. We went to check into our hotel and roam around the area. The next day, we went to the Kuirau Park
    and Red woods. We tried the tree walk and it was 'Treerific'. We then went to skyline and tried tons of rides.

    <h3 class="title">New Year's Eve</h3>
    <br>
    <h5 class="dates">December 31, 2024</h5>
    <br>
    <p class="description">As the adults were preparing for New Year's Eve, my sister, my cousins and I played in a basketball court
    and trained. Though I lost a couple of times (well I accepted it cause my cousin plays for his school), we still
    enjoyed bonding together. Around 9 p.m., we all dressed in our pyjama uniforms and went to Hobson Wharf. We
    ate snacks, played on the see-saw, and took a couple of family photos. As the timer hit 0, we all welcomed and
    celebrated the New Year.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Their flight back to LA</h3>
    <h5 class="dates">January 2,2025</h5>
    <p class="description">We left at 3 a.m. as their flight leaves in 8 a.m. and we don't want to rush things around so we decided to
    just go early. We bid our byes and wished them a safe flight back. </p>
